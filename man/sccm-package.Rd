\title{sccm: Schwarz-Christoffel Conformal Maps}
\description{
Provide a conformal mapping of one 2D polygon to a rectangular region via the
Schwarz-Christoffel theorem.

Methods are provide to find a convex hull for an arbitrary set (x, y)
coordinates.  This hull, and the points within, are, via an (inverse)
Schwarz-Christoffel mapping, mapped to the unit disk.  A second
Schwarz-Christoffel mapping from the unit disk to an arbitrary rectangle is use
to finish the conformal mapping.

This package builds hulls via Andrew's monotone chain algorithm implemented in
C++. The Schwarz-Christoffel mappings are provided by the FORTRAN SCPACK by
Lloyd N. Trefethen.

\section{Acknowledgments}{

This package is based on the work of two other packages:
\code{contoureR} by Nicholas Hamilton and 
\code{conformal} by Nick Ellis.  The former provided insight on
construction of the convex hulls, the later provided the insight into the
FORTRAN interface.  The \code{sccm} package provides a subset of the tools
provided by these two packages, and does so with a different API.
